# AVL-tree
AVL tree implementation

AVL tree implementation. I faced big problems while programming this tree but also learned a lot. It works, balances itself, it's tested but unfortunely code is unfortunely the opposite of what you call good, clean code. :(

Those tests "input#output#" applies to a specific problem from my University PJATK in Warsaw so I can't share it publicly. But you can use AVL implementation and I can show you the problem if you ask about it.
